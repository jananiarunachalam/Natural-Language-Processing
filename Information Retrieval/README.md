# Information Retrieval 

The learning goals of this project are:
<ul>
<li>how to build inverted indexes
<li>how to implement Boolean information retrieval
<li>adding weighting e.g. TF-IDF to IR algorithm
</ul>

<br>

A small set of data in the form of tweets is available in tweets_corpus.txt. Each line in the file begins with a document ID, followed by the text of
the tweet.
